# html-css-project
# Introduction  
This is my first project in html/css ever.  
I learned HTML/CSS through Youtube and created this project to practice what I have learned.  
# About  
A small website for browsing tea and coffee.  
Alongside HTML and CSS, I've also implemented JavaScript to animate the navigation bar 
enhancing the user experience and providing a dynamic touch to the website navigation.
